    Creates a randomized test, development and training set containing what is inside the input file, each in a
    compressed file.
    The sets are randomized by using two Algorithm R.
    THe first algorithm R fills the container for the test set. Elements which are not added to the test set
    or are removed from it are then considered for the development set. THe second algorithm R fills the container
    for the development set. If they are not added to the development set or are removed from it, they are put into
    the training set. To save RAM, abstracts are written right away to the training set (instead of being
    saved in a container).
